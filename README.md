# BreakthroughGame
Breakthrough is an abstract strategy board game invented by Dan Troyka in 2000 and made available as a Zillions of Games file (ZRF). 
It won the 2001 8x8 Game Design Competition, even though the game was originally played on a 7x7 board, as it is trivially extensible
to larger board sizes.

Here we want to implement agents to play the above game, one using minimax search and one using alpha-beta search.

Features that were taken into consideration include “important pieces”, “connected pairs of pieces”, etc. Accept parameters' configuration to make the agent more aggresive/defensive.
